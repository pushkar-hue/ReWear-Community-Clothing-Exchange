# ReWear-Community-Clothing-Exchange

## Problem Statement

ReWear is a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of discarding them.
Overview

The platform allows users to upload their unused clothing items, browse items listed by others, and either propose a direct swap or redeem clothing using earned points. ReWear promotes eco-friendly consumption by simplifying clothing reuse through an intuitive interface.
